# React Computers 3D Scene

An interactive and customizable 3D scene featuring a collection of vintage computers, built with React and the Three.js ecosystem. The application is rendered in real-time and includes a control panel to dynamically change various aspects of the scene, such as text, colors, and animations.

## üîß How It Works & Modification Guide

The project structure is organized to be modular and easy to understand.

*   **`src/App.tsx`**: This is the main entry point for the 3D scene. It sets up the `Canvas`, lighting, post-processing effects, and the Leva control panel using the `useControls` hook. All customizable properties are defined here and passed down as props to the `Computers` component.

*   **`src/Computers.tsx`**: This component is responsible for rendering the main computer scene. It loads the GLTF model and dynamically renders the interactive screens (`ScreenText`, `ScreenInteractive`) based on the props received from `App.tsx`. To change which monitors display which content, you can modify the components called at the bottom of this file.

*   **`src/SpinningBox.tsx`**: This component renders the dynamic shape in the central monitor. It receives props to control its geometry (`shapeType`), color, scale, and animation behavior (rotation, hover effects). You can easily add more shapes by extending the `Shape` component within this file.

To modify the application, simply adjust the components or change the default values in the `useControls` hook in `App.tsx`.
